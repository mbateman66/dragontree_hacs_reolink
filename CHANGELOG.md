# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented here.
Format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/).
Versioning follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [1.2.2] - 2026-03-01

### Added
- Playback list updates automatically when new recordings finish downloading —
  no page refresh required. Uses an HA event bus subscription so the list
  refreshes in real time while preserving the currently selected recording.

## [1.2.1] - 2026-03-01

### Changed
- Playback list: time of day is now displayed above the tag badges (right column),
  at normal font size/weight; date and duration remain in the left info column
- Prev/Next navigation buttons (and auto-advance on playback end) now always move
  backward/forward in time regardless of the current sort order

## [1.2.0] - 2026-03-01

### Changed
- Refactored to follow the official HA integration blueprint conventions:
  - `data.py` — new `DragontreeReolinkData` dataclass + typed `DragontreeReolinkConfigEntry`
    alias (`ConfigEntry[DragontreeReolinkData]`); `entry.runtime_data` is now typed
  - `entity.py` — new `DragontreeReolinkEntity` base class; deduplicates `device_info`,
    `has_entity_name`, `should_poll`, and dispatcher wiring across all platforms
  - `const.py` — `LOGGER` via `getLogger(__package__)`; all modules now import this
    single logger instead of creating per-module `_LOGGER` instances
  - `sensor.py` / `number.py` — use typed config entry, access coordinator via
    `entry.runtime_data.coordinator`, extend `DragontreeReolinkEntity`
  - `config_flow.py` — `ConfigFlowResult` return type; `selector.NumberSelector` and
    `selector.SelectSelector` for form fields; modern `OptionsFlow` pattern (no custom
    `__init__`, accesses `self.config_entry` directly)
  - `Platform` enum used in `PLATFORMS` list; `HomeAssistant` imported under
    `TYPE_CHECKING` throughout

## [1.1.0] - 2026-03-01

### Changed
- Dashboard is now registered automatically in the HA sidebar — no `configuration.yaml`
  edits required. Uses `LovelaceYAML` + `_register_panel` to serve the bundled YAML
  directly from the integration package.
- Lovelace card JS is now registered via `add_extra_js_url` instead of the
  `.storage/lovelace_resources` file. Any stale resource entries are cleaned up
  automatically on first run after upgrading.
- Added `"dependencies": ["lovelace", "http", "frontend"]` to `manifest.json` to
  guarantee these HA subsystems are ready before setup.
- Dashboard and JS files are now organised into `lovelace/` and `js/` subdirectories.

### Removed
- Dashboard file copy and persistent notification on first install (superseded by
  automatic dashboard registration).

## [1.0.1] - 2026-03-01

### Fixed
- Dashboard YAML is now automatically copied to `dashboards/dragontree_reolink_cameras.yaml`
  in the HA config directory on first setup, and a persistent notification provides the exact
  `configuration.yaml` snippet to add — no manual file-path hunting after a HACS install

## [1.0.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- Initial release
- Downloads recordings from Reolink cameras to local media storage
- Motion-triggered downloads with configurable delays
- Periodic polling (60 s) as a safety net
- SQLite metadata database with AI trigger tags (ANIMAL, VEHICLE, PERSON)
- Full-size and thumbnail JPEG extraction for each recording (requires `av`)
- Disk space management — oldest recordings deleted when limit is exceeded
- `number` entity for configuring max disk space (default 5 GB)
- Sensors: disk used, queue size, total recordings, last download
- WebSocket API: `dragontree_reolink/get_recordings`, `dragontree_reolink/get_cameras`
- Lovelace card `dragontree-reolink-playback` — 3-panel recording browser
  with video player, collapsible filter panel, and scrollable recording list
- Bundled card JS served automatically; Lovelace resource auto-registered on setup
